## Project Overview

The projects progress from fundamental quantum mechanics to advanced noise modeling, reflecting a deep dive into the practical software stack used in cutting-edge quantum research.

### 1. **Quantum State & Entanglement Fidelity under Noise**
**Location:** `bell_state_analysis/`
**Tools:** Qiskit (Aer, Terra), Matplotlib
**Description:** Generated and analyzed Bell states to understand the fundamental resource of entanglement. A key focus was benchmarking fidelity degradation under a realistic depolarizing noise model, providing a baseline for quantifying error susceptibility.
**Relevance:** Establishes a methodology for quantifying the impact of environmental noise on quantum states, a critical task for validating hardware performance.

### 2. **Quantum Algorithm Advantage & Benchmarking**
**Location:** `grover_deutsch_jozsa/`
**Tools:** Qiskit (Aer, Terra)
**Description:** Implemented and validated core quantum algorithms to demonstrate quantum advantage.
- **Grover's Algorithm (2-qubit):** Achieved ~100% success probability in identifying a marked state, showcasing amplitude amplification.
- **Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm (3-qubit):** Deterministically solved the problem in a single oracle query, empirically verifying quantum speed-up over classical counterparts.
**Relevance:** Provides a framework for testing and benchmarking quantum processors on standardized algorithmic tasks.

### 3. **Superconducting Qubit Noise Modeling & Coherence Analysis**
**Location:** `superconducting_noise_modeling/`
**Tools:** Qiskit Aer Noise Module, NumPy, Matplotlib
**Description:** Developed a comprehensive noise model simulating key decoherence channels (T₁, T₂) and depolarizing error in superconducting qubits. Quantified the fidelity decay of quantum operations over time under realistic coherence parameters.
**Relevance:** Directly mirrors the primary challenges in quantum hardware development. This simulation expertise is crucial for predicting qubit performance, designing error mitigation strategies, and setting coherence targets for experimental systems.

### 4. **Reproducible Research Environment**
**Location:** `qbraid.yaml`, `requirements.txt`
**Tools:** qBraid Lab, Python 3.10, Qiskit 1.0.2+
**Description:** Configured a fully containerized and version-controlled environment to ensure all simulations are reproducible and shareable across different platforms.
**Relevance:** Demonstrates professional-grade research practices, ensuring that results can be independently verified by collaborators or reviewers, a critical aspect of academic research.

## Professional Context

This software-based research complements my hands-on hardware experience at **ISRO**, where I:
- Characterized cryogenic microwave components (amplifiers, cables) at 4 K.
- Developed thermal noise budgets for high-sensitivity receiver chains.
- Validated system performance using VNA S-parameter analysis.

This unique perspective allows me to bridge the gap between abstract quantum information theory and the practical constraints of real-world quantum hardware.
