Overview
This repository contains code and notebooks from my independent research in quantum computing, complementing my professional background in cryogenic microwave engineering at ISRO. It demonstrates a practical understanding of quantum algorithms, noise processes, and pulse-level control, directly relevant to experimental superconducting quantum computation.

üìÑ For a detailed analysis, discussion, and critical insights, please see the formal Research Portfolio PDF.
