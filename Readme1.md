## Overview

This repository contains the code and simulations for my self-directed research in quantum computing. This work bridges my professional background in **cryogenic microwave engineering at ISRO** with the software and theoretical foundations of superconducting quantum computation. It demonstrates a practical understanding of quantum algorithms, noise processes, and pulse-level control, directly relevant to experimental device characterization and error mitigation.
